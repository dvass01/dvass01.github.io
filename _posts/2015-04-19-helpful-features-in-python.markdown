I learned some very helpful features about Python today after reading Sahand Saba's blog entitled "Math u Code".  One of the most helpful for me involved double-ended queues.

The collections module enables Python users to utilize the deque container, which supports some useful methods such as appendleft, extendleft, popleft, reverse, rotate and others.  I will present an example tomorrow morning in my programming class to illustrate how these methods are used.  I plan on using these deque objects in my own work.  As I write this post, I am thinking of situations in the past where they would have come in very handy.
