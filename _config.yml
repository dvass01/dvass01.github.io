  This is the beginning of my journey.  My goal is to become a programmer
  in the field of finance.  Merging these two areas of interest would
  be a thrill for me.  I will post topics on this blog that spark my
  interest and help me arrive at a better understanding with respect to
  developing financial applications.  I hope that readers of my blog
  are also interested in these topics.
